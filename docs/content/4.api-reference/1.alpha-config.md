description: Configure validation for alphabetic input, allowing customization of whitespace, locale, and additional valid characters..  
---
The AlphaConfig interface extends the [BaseValidatorConfig](/api-reference/base-validator-config) interface to provide additional configuration options specifically for validating alphabetic input. It allows you to tailor the validation behavior for alphabetic fields within your forms.
#### Inheritence
* Inherits all properties from [BaseValidatorConfig](/api-reference/base-validator-config).
#### Properties:

* `allowWhiteSpace` (Optional): A boolean value indicating whether whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, tabs) are considered valid input. Defaults to false if not specified.
* `locale` (Optional): A string specifying the locale for character set validation. This can influence which characters are considered alphabetic based on regional variations (e.g., some languages might include accented characters).
* `allowCharacters` (Optional): A string containing additional characters that should be considered valid along with standard alphabetic characters (a-z and A-Z). This allows you to include special characters like hyphens (-) or underscores (_) as valid input if needed.
