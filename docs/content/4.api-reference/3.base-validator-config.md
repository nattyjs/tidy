title: BaseValidatorConfig
description: This interface defines a set of configuration options that can be applied to various validators.  
---
## Properties:
* `message` (Optional): A string representing a custom error message to display if the validation fails.
* `conditionalExpression` (Optional): A function that determines whether to apply the validator based on certain conditions. This function should take two arguments: currentFormGroupValue (the current value of the FormGroup containing the field being validated) and rootFormGroupValue (the value of the root FormGroup).
* `messageKey` (Optional): A string key used to lookup a custom error message from a translation resource. This allows for dynamic localization of error messages based on user language.
