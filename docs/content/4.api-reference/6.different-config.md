description: Configure to provide a way to associate a field name with a validator. 
---
The DifferentConfig interface extends the [BaseValidatorConfig](/api-reference/base-validator-config) interface to provide a way to associate a field name with a validator. 
#### Inheritence
* Inherits all properties from [BaseValidatorConfig](/api-reference/base-validator-config).
#### Properties:
* `fieldName` (Optional): Current property is matched with the particular property. So we need to pass particular property name.
