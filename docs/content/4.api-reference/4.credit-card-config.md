title: CreditCardConfig 
description: Configure credit card validation, allowing specification of accepted types. 
---
The `CreditCardConfig` interface extends the [BaseValidatorConfig](/api-reference/base-validator-config) interface to provide configuration options for credit card validation. It allows you to specify accepted credit card types.
#### Inheritence
* Inherits all properties from [BaseValidatorConfig](/api-reference/base-validator-config).
#### Properties:
* `creditCardTypes` (Optional): An array containing strings that represent the accepted credit card types (e.g., "visa", "mastercard", "amex"). If not specified, validation likely applies to all common card types.
